Hey, 
this is my small Sudoku project!
Im just starting to learn python and heard about Matplotlib. 
I love sudokus so i thought about generating them in python and visualising them with matplotlib.
Try it yourself and have fun!
If you have ideas or found a way to make it better, just write me a message :)
